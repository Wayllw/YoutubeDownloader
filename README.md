This code is just a small project.
It contains the founding code of a functioning youtube video downloader.
The code possesses an executable file so we can use the program without the need to open the IDE.
U can relocate the executable anywhere.

It works the following way:
1-You open the executable (or execute the code in your IDE);
2-You copy the URL of the video you want to download;
3-In the interface you paste the copied URL;
4-Press the download button;
5-U wait, the time will be proportional to the video size;
6-When the interface closes there will be a folder in your desktop with the video inside.

//Note that if you download 2+ videos, all of them will be put inside that same folder, only 1 singular folder will be created unless you rename or delete the initial folder.
//Updates on the making are related to being able to choose the folder where the video will be stored, instead of a default folder and adding the ability to download only video or audio.
